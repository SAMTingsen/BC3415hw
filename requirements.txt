Qn1: Why is prediction important across diverse fields, and how does it influence decision-making processes?
Prediction is crucial across different fields because itâ€™s a key part of managing risks. It uses past data to forecast possible future scenarios, 
which helps people make informed decisions. With accurate predictions, companies can save a lot of resources by being better prepared for the changes they expect.

Qn2: What methods are commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of prediction models?
For continuous predictions, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is often used. 
RMSE measures the average magnitude of errors between predicted and actual values, giving a clear sense of how far off predictions are from the true outcomes.
For categorical predictions, the Confusion Matrix is applied. 
It provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, which helps in assessing the model's accuracy and overall effectiveness.

Qn3: What role do emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and deep learning play in advancing prediction capabilities and applications?
Artificial intelligence and deep learning have strong learning abilities, especially in recognizing patterns. They can assist people in making predictions by quickly sorting out 
these patterns. For instance, in healthcare, AI and deep learning are used to analyze medical images (such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans) to detect patterns 
that indicate diseases like cancer, tumors, or neurological disorders.
